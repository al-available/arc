      <blockquote>
        "We didn't have a building. We didn't have a budget.
        We didn't even have a plan. All we had was a living
        room, twelve broken people, and a God who
        specializes in impossible beginnings."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In the spring of 2018, Pastor gathered a
        handful of strangers in his home. They were teachers,
        mechanics, students, and single mothers — none of them
        qualified by the world's standards, all of them hungry
        for something real.
      </p>

      <p>
        That first night, they prayed until the sun came up.
        No one wanted to leave. What happened in that living
        room was not religious. It was raw. Honest. Desperate.
        People who had given up on church found themselves
        weeping in the presence of God. Marriages on the verge
        of collapse found hope. A man who hadn't spoken to his
        father in ten years picked up the phone that night.
      </p>

      <p>
        ARC — <strong>The Ark of God</strong> — was never meant
        to be just another church. It was born to be a
        <span class="highlight">refuge for the broken</span>,
        a <span class="highlight">launchpad for the called</span>,
        and a <span class="highlight">home for everyone in between</span>.
